            #https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/blob/master/bindings/python/rgbmatrix/core.pyx on line 12). I'm not sure what the first line below this message does,
            #since it is overwritten right away in the second line below this message. The second line below this message defines the image file parameter mentioned earlier as
            #the file that was opened, resized, and converted into RGB previously in the code. The second parameter is the offset x-value, and this line sets that to a quick
            #addition problem: -xpos + img_width. This essentially takes the xpos variable value, makes it negative, and adds it to the width of the image. This means that the
            #offset x-value will get smaller and smaller as this code loops, creating the scrolling effect.

            #be on the LED panels. "SwapOnVSync" essentially swaps out the active display (which is just a blank screen the first time this runs) with the supplied display (which
            #is what the "SetImage" function did just a line earlier). So each time the "SetImage" function is run, the supplied display changes and

#Things I'm still confused about:
# 1. How does this script call "self.args" if that was only defined in samplebase.py? Does that mean that all variables from samplebase.py are now in this script?
# 2. According to this line: "self.image.resize((self.matrix.width, self.matrix.height), Image.ANTIALIAS)", the image width and height are set to the width and height of the
#    LED matrix panel. But if that's true, the image would have to be 32x32, meaning it doesn't need to scroll since it already fits in the screen.
#    Answer: I'm thinking that maybe it does change the image's resolution to that of the matrix panels, but it keeps the same aspect ratio. This would cause only part of the
#    image to show, which could then be scrolled by changing the x-position.
# 3. Why is there two separate lines that do SetImage.()? Wouldn't there only need to be one since the panel isn't actually being updated until after those two lines?
